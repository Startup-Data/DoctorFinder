# Introduction:

Waste management is a critical issue facing many countries around the world. Improper waste management practices can have significant negative impacts on the environment, human health, and economies. Traditional waste management practices, such as landfilling and incineration, are not sustainable in the long term. Therefore, there is a need to explore more sustainable waste management practices that align with the principles of the sustainable economy. This proposal aims to investigate the use of the 3 pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management.

# Research Question:

How can the implementation of the 3 pillars of the sustainable economy contribute to more sustainable waste management practices?

# Methodology:

This study will use a literature review and case studies to investigate the research question. The literature review will include a comprehensive analysis of the 3 pillars of the sustainable economy and their potential application in waste management. The case studies will analyze waste management practices in different regions to identify how the implementation of the 3 pillars of the sustainable economy can contribute to more sustainable waste management practices.

# Implications:

This research has significant implications for waste management practices and policymakers. The 3 pillars of the sustainable economy can provide a framework for more sustainable waste management practices that align with sustainable development goals. The research findings can inform policymakers about the potential benefits of implementing the 3 pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management practices.

# Expected Results:

The expected results of this research include a framework for sustainable waste management practices that align with the 3 pillars of the sustainable economy. The case studies will provide examples of how the implementation of these pillars can contribute to more sustainable waste management practices. The research findings will also provide recommendations for policymakers and waste management professionals on how to implement these pillars in waste management practices.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the 3 pillars of the sustainable economy can provide a framework for more sustainable waste management practices. This research will investigate how the implementation of these pillars can contribute to more sustainable waste management practices.
