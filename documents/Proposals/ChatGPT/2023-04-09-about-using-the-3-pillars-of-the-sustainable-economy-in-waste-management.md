This proposal aims to discuss the use of the three pillars of the sustainable economy – environmental, social, and economic – in waste management. It will focus on the development of an Android application-based software for waste collection shares in the global market size of waste management. Additionally, it will discuss the implications, expected results, and conclusion of this endeavor. The intended audience for this proposal are professionals and university masters.

#Title
Using The 3 Pillars of the Sustainable Economy in Waste Management 

#Introduction
The world is facing an environmental crisis due to the increasing amount of waste being produced. Waste management is an essential part of sustainability and is one of the most important components of the global economy. The three pillars of the sustainable economy – environmental, social, and economic – are the basis for achieving sustainability and are essential components of a successful waste management system. This proposal aims to discuss the use of the three pillars of the sustainable economy – environmental, social, and economic – in waste management. It will focus on the development of an Android application-based software for waste collection shares in the global market size of waste management. Additionally, it will discuss the implications, expected results, and conclusion of this endeavor. 

#Research Question
What are the implications of using the three pillars of the sustainable economy – environmental, social, and economic – in waste management?

#Methodology
The methodology used in this research proposal will be a combination of qualitative and quantitative research. The qualitative research will involve interviews with experts in the waste management field to gain insight into the current state of waste management and the potential for implementing the three pillars of the sustainable economy. The quantitative research will involve the collection and analysis of data from the global market size of waste management in order to determine the potential for an Android application-based software for waste collection shares. 

#Implications
The implementation of the three pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management has the potential to have a positive impact on the environment, society, and economy. Environmentally, the implementation of the three pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management would reduce the amount of waste being produced and increase the efficiency of waste management systems. Socially, the implementation of the three pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management would create jobs and increase access to resources for those living in poverty. Economically, the implementation of the three pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management would increase the global market size of waste management and create opportunities for investment in the waste management sector. 

#Expected Results
The expected results of this research proposal are the development of an Android application-based software for waste collection shares in the global market size of waste management. This software would be designed to facilitate the efficient collection and disposal of waste and would be integrated into existing waste management systems. Additionally, this software would provide access to resources and information to those living in poverty and would create jobs in the waste management sector. 

#Conclusion
The implementation of the three pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management has the potential to have a positive impact on the environment, society, and economy. The development of an Android application-based software for waste collection shares in the global market size of waste management would facilitate the efficient collection and disposal of waste, provide access to resources and information to those living in poverty, and create jobs in the waste management sector.
