The concept of sustainable development has gained a lot of attention in the past few decades. It is a comprehensive approach that considers economic, social and environmental aspects as key components of development. Waste management is an integral part of sustainable development, as it is the process of minimizing, reusing and recycling waste materials. In this proposal, we will evaluate the waste management practices and their contribution to the three pillars of sustainable development, namely economic, social and environmental sustainability. The research question is: How does waste management contribute to the three pillars of sustainable development?

Research Question 
How does waste management contribute to the three pillars of sustainable development?

Methodology
The research will involve a literature review of existing studies on waste management and its contribution to the three pillars of sustainability. The research will include an analysis of the existing studies and the findings from these studies. It will also involve a discussion of the implications of these findings for sustainable development. The research will also consider the potential benefits and limitations of waste management in terms of its contribution to the three pillars of sustainable development.

Implication
The research will provide an insight into the role of waste management in sustainable development. It will enable us to identify the potential benefits and limitations of waste management as a tool for sustainable development. Additionally, it will enable us to identify potential areas for improvement in terms of waste management practices. The research will also provide a basis for developing strategies that are more effective in terms of waste management and its contribution to the three pillars of sustainability.

Expected Result
It is expected that the research will provide an understanding of the role of waste management in sustainable development. The research will enable us to identify the potential benefits and limitations of waste management in terms of its contribution to the three pillars of sustainability. Additionally, the research will provide a basis for developing strategies that are more effective in terms of waste management and its contribution to the three pillars of sustainability.

Conclusion
The research will provide an insight into the role of waste management in sustainable development. It will enable us to identify the potential benefits and limitations of waste management as a tool for sustainable development. Additionally, it will enable us to identify potential areas for improvement in terms of waste management practices. The research will also provide a basis for developing strategies that are more effective in terms of waste management and its contribution to the three pillars of sustainability.
