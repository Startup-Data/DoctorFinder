This proposal seeks to explore the potential of using the three pillars of the sustainable economy – environmental protection, economic prosperity, and social equity – in waste management. It will examine the current global market size of waste management and how it can be improved with the use of the three pillars. Additionally, it will assess the potential use of an Android application-based software for waste collection and its impact on the global market size. Finally, the implications of this research will be discussed, as well as the expected results and conclusion. 

#Introduction
The world is facing an unprecedented waste crisis. Since the 1950s, the amount of waste produced by humans has increased exponentially, and with it, the amount of waste that is disposed of in landfills, oceans, and other places. This has had a devastating effect on the environment and has caused numerous environmental problems, such as climate change, air and water pollution, and the destruction of habitats and ecosystems. In order to address this crisis, governments and organizations around the world have begun to implement sustainable waste management policies and practices. 

The concept of sustainability has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it is often used to refer to the three pillars of the sustainable economy – environmental protection, economic prosperity, and social equity. These three pillars are essential to creating a sustainable economy, and they can also be applied to waste management. By using these three pillars, governments and organizations can create effective waste management policies and practices that are both environmentally friendly and economically beneficial. 

#Research Question
This proposal seeks to answer the following research question: What is the potential of using the three pillars of the sustainable economy – environmental protection, economic prosperity, and social equity – in waste management? 

#Methodology
In order to answer the research question, this proposal will use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. First, a literature review will be conducted to gain an understanding of the current global market size of waste management and the potential of using the three pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management. This literature review will include both academic and non-academic sources, such as reports from organizations, government documents, and news articles. 

Second, a survey will be conducted to gain an understanding of the potential use of an Android application-based software for waste collection and its impact on the global market size of waste management. The survey will include questions about the potential use of the software, its potential impact on the global market size, and the participants’ opinions on the use of the three pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management. 

Third, interviews will be conducted with experts in the field of waste management to gain an understanding of their opinions on the potential of using the three pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management. The interviews will include questions about the potential use of the software, its potential impact on the global market size, and the experts’ opinions on the use of the three pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management.

#Implications
The results of this research will have implications for governments, organizations, and individuals around the world. Governments and organizations will be able to use the results of this research to create more effective waste management policies and practices that are both environmentally friendly and economically beneficial. Additionally, individuals will be able to use the results of this research to make more informed decisions about their own waste management practices.

#Expected Results
It is expected that this research will show that the use of the three pillars of the sustainable economy – environmental protection, economic prosperity, and social equity – in waste management can have a positive impact on the global market size of waste management. Additionally, it is expected that the research will show that the use of an Android application-based software for waste collection can have a positive impact on the global market size of waste management.

#Conclusion
This proposal seeks to explore the potential of using the three pillars of the sustainable economy – environmental protection, economic prosperity, and social equity – in waste management. By using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, this research will examine the current global market size of waste management and how it can be improved with the use of the three pillars. Additionally, it will assess the potential use of an Android application-based software for waste collection and its impact on the global market size. The results of this research will have implications for governments, organizations, and individuals around the world, and it is expected that this research will show that the use of the three pillars of the sustainable economy in waste management can have a positive impact on the global market size of waste management.
