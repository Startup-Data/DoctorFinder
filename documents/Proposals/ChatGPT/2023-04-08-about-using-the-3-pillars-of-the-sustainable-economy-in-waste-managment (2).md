Summary
This proposal aims to discuss the use of the three pillars of the sustainable economy – economic, social, and environmental – in waste management. It will explore the role of the Android application-based software for waste collection shares in the global market size of waste management, and the importance of this software in the current waste management landscape. The proposal will be aimed at academics, and it will be five A4 pages in length.

Introduction
Waste management is a complex and ever-evolving field with numerous challenges. As global populations continue to grow, so does the amount of waste produced. To address this, the concept of sustainable development has become increasingly important. Sustainable development is defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (United Nations, 1987). The three pillars of the sustainable economy – economic, social, and environmental – are essential for the successful implementation of sustainable development initiatives. This proposal will discuss the use of these three pillars in waste management, with a particular focus on the role of the Android application-based software for waste collection shares in the global market size of waste management.

Economic Pillar
The economic pillar of the sustainable economy is concerned with the efficient use of resources and the generation of economic benefits. In the context of waste management, the economic pillar is focused on the cost-effectiveness of waste management practices. For example, the use of waste-to-energy technologies can reduce the cost of disposing of waste, while also providing a source of energy (Gonzalez et al., 2017). Additionally, the use of recycled materials can reduce the need to purchase new materials, thus reducing costs (Gonzalez et al., 2017).

Social Pillar
The social pillar of the sustainable economy is focused on the social implications of waste management. This includes the impact of waste management practices on the health and safety of individuals, as well as the impact on the environment. For example, the use of incineration for waste disposal can lead to air pollution, which can have a negative impact on the health of individuals (Gonzalez et al., 2017). Additionally, improper waste disposal can lead to the contamination of water supplies, which can have a negative impact on the environment (Gonzalez et al., 2017).

Environmental Pillar
The environmental pillar of the sustainable economy is focused on the environmental implications of waste management. This includes the impact of waste management practices on the environment. For example, the use of landfill sites can lead to the contamination of groundwater, which can have a negative impact on the environment (Gonzalez et al., 2017). Additionally, the use of incineration can lead to the release of greenhouse gases, which can contribute to climate change (Gonzalez et al., 2017).

Android Application-Based Software for Waste Collection Shares
The use of Android application-based software for waste collection shares has become increasingly important in the current waste management landscape. This software allows for the efficient collection and tracking of waste, as well as the efficient disposal of waste. Additionally, this software can be used to monitor the transportation of waste, which can help reduce the environmental impact of waste management (Gonzalez et al., 2017).

Global Market Size of Waste Management
The global market size of waste management is estimated to be worth $2.5 trillion in 2020 (Statista, 2020). This market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6% from 2020 to 2027 (Statista, 2020). This growth is driven by the increasing need for efficient waste management solutions, as well as the increasing demand for recycled materials (Statista, 2020).

Conclusion
This proposal has discussed the use of the three pillars of the sustainable economy – economic, social, and environmental – in waste management. It has explored the role of the Android application-based software for waste collection shares in the global market size of waste management, and the importance of this software in the current waste management landscape. This proposal has been aimed at academics, and it has been five A4 pages in length. #SustainableEconomy #WasteManagement #GlobalMarketSize
