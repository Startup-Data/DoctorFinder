# This pages show the current task for doing in this project:

## Task 1:

> I have one Waste management project ([link][1]) which have had one
> smart trash bin made by Arduino ( ESP8266). 
> 
> I have one AI music composer code on the Google Colaboratory page
> which receive one monophonic Audio and create some instrument like
> violin, flute  or other musical instrument sound based on the input
> music. 
> 
> 
> So I want to upload the recorded sound by Arduino microphone to
> internet, and needs to built one API command and send it to python
> Host (like [pythonanywhere][2]), for sending API to one VPS  (better
> to find free VPS for test like [Docker VPS][3] or ...), And run the
> Colaboratory codes for making music ([link][4]), and uploading the
> made music file into YouTube or SoundCloud Servers.
> 
> SO based of Above Steps I have asked the below questions:
> 
> 1- how to upload one music files to SoundCloud or Music Host by
> Arduino and ESP8266. 2- About automatic Uploading one music to
> SoundCloud or YouTube by Python language  3- how to use pythonanywhere
> free host for running the AI codes on Google Colaboratory, Kaggle or
> play-with-docker Free VSP
