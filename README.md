1. **Start** opening these codes via **Android Studio**
2. **Built** the **APK** application of the main codes with **no changes** on them. Can use Gitpod as you cans do by https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Startup-Data/SatLunNeh like this:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6679151/112917385-c0366e00-9117-11eb-8763-d1136b43ffdb.png)

3. **Change** the **Doctors** and **patients** to **Garbage buyers and garbage sellers**.
4. **Built** the **APK** file and **test** the Application on **some devices**( **Ask** about **how fast could test one application by online sites** [here](https://android.stackexchange.com/).
5. If **the APK** file and the **codes** are working **right**, **try** **to find** one mechanism to **automatically change the Language** to a **different language like Arabic** and ..., so it could be done **faster** by asking one question about finding site or android modules to translate the APK codes automatically as a tool for android developers [**here**](https://android.stackexchange.com/)
6. **Ask** about the **Proper VPS host Provider** (**Minimum cost** and ...) [here](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/) like this question :
   [a good VPS to grow into (cheap at start, multiple sites, php and python, easily custom-configurable)](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/17848/a-good-vps-to-grow-into-cheap-at-start-multiple-sites-php-and-python-easily) or [How to find web hosting that meets my requirements?
](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/20838/how-to-find-web-hosting-that-meets-my-requirements)
7. **Find the proper CMS** for **building it sites** by **asking** [here](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/) or [here](https://sitecore.stackexchange.com/) **like this question**:
[What is the best place to ask an opinion about which CMS is the most appropriate for my task?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212874/what-is-the-best-place-to-ask-an-opinion-about-which-cms-is-the-most-appropriate/212876)
8. **Find** the proper **CMS project** on **GitHub** and **write** the **TODO list** on its **README.MD** like this **TODO list** on this page.

The presentation of this project on one Academic event could be seen [here](https://github.com/Startup-Data/SatLunNeh/raw/master/garbage-odp2%20for%20competition.pdf)
