> Subject: Proposal for Sustainable Android Application for Waste

> Management - SGP Program

> 

> Dear Bazzel Convention Team,

> 

> We are excited to submit a proposal for the Sustainable Android

> Application for Waste Management as part of the SGP Program at the

> upcoming conference. Our goal is to create a sustainable Android

> application for waste management, which will be based on the 3SD model

> (Social, Sustainable, and Economic) and incorporate revenue sharing

> and profit sharing principles.

> 

> Revenue sharing and profit sharing are essential aspects of our

> proposed application. We plan on implementing revenue sharing to

> ensure that all stakeholders, including users, employees, and

> investors, benefit from the application's success. The revenue sharing

> model will encourage users to participate in waste management

> activities by providing them with a portion of the revenue generated

> by the application. This will not only promote sustainable practices

> but also create a sense of ownership and responsibility among users.

> 

> Profit sharing will also be incorporated into the application,

> allowing employees and shareholders to receive a portion of the

> profits generated. This will help to motivate employees and attract

> future investors, as well as strengthen the long-term relationship

> between the firm and its stakeholders.

> 

> To further enhance the sustainability and profitability of the waste

> management application, we plan on introducing a blockchain-based

> cryptocurrency. This will allow users to receive their share of the

> profit in the form of cryptocurrency, which can be used for various

> purposes, such as further investments or transactions within the

> application. The use of cryptocurrency in the application will

> facilitate cross-border transactions, enabling users in different

> countries to participate in waste management activities and receive

> their share of the profits.

> 

> The waste management market has a significant collection percentage

> share, which is crucial for the success of our proposed application.

> By incorporating revenue sharing and profit sharing principles, the

> application will be able to attract more users and generate more

> revenue, thus increasing its market share and profitability. By

> focusing on the waste management market, the application will be able

> to capitalize on the growing demand for sustainable waste management

> solutions, as well as the increasing need for efficient and profitable

> waste management practices.

> 

> Based on the estimated collection share in the global waste management

> market size, which ranges from $126.92 billion to $211.7 billion, our

> proposed application has significant potential to generate revenue. We

> believe that our proposal aligns well with the goals of the SGP

> Program and would be an excellent addition to the conference.

> 

> We would like to present our proposal and discuss its potential

> benefits with other attendees and interested parties. We are confident

> that our proposed Sustainable Android Application for Waste Management

> will not only promote sustainable waste management practices but also

> generate profit for its users.

> 

> Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to hearing

> back from you soon.

> 

> Best regards,
